[More than Music](https://more-than-music-7a11baa48e88.herokuapp.com/) is an application that combines musicianship with Christian values. It invites musicians to unite with a common purpose. 

I am a musician and a Christian, and my intent with this project was to create a platform through which Christian musicians like myself could share and collaborate on their music as a way of working towards a common goal, to share God's love.

To get a better idea of the brainstorming and work that went into this project, you can look at my [Trello board](https://trello.com/invite/b/U03K7kOs/ATTI87c57ff6b7c368de43137d74dfa5f926687B5669/ga-project-2-web-app).

## Attributions

I did not use too many external sources for this project. However, I did borrow some tips from a Youtube tutorial on CSS. I also used some minor help from Stack Overflow.

Here is a list of my attributions:

* I used [this video](https://youtu.be/jEuvbVVkcT0?si=0f8E-YTEKJPGx7lx) on youtube to help me put CSS box-shadow on my inputs

* I used [this article](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3518002/how-can-i-set-the-default-value-for-an-html-select-element) on Stack Overflow to help me set the default option in an HTML select element.

* I used [this article](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18629327/adding-css-file-to-ejs) on Stack Overflow to help me find another way to connect CSS sheets to my EJS files. The method I originally tried was not working.

## Next Steps (Stretch Goals)

* allow producers to upload the audio for their beat
